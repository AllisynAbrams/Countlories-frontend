## Countlories

Countlories is a calories tracking app where users can populate what they ate at what time, and how many calories is in what they ate. Each day will keep track of the total calorie count as well as having an edit and delete button. There is also a page dedicated to showing the hard work that the amazing Countlories team put in to make this project come to life!

## Features

Countlories uses Framer Motion to make a somewhat plain and simplistic app into something that feels more alive. With the usage of an animation library a form pops up as modals for users to make inputs rather than being redirected. It is also the main styling of our team page to ensure each team members' contribution gets the space it deserves.
